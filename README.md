# COSC499_IndividualGitExercise

***This program allows the users to sort a list of elements.***

- The user is asked to choose a data type (Integer or String).
- The user is then asked for the number of list elements (maximum 20).
- The user is then asked to enter the list elements.
- The list is then sorted based on the data type of the elements.

***Integer Sorting***

- This part of the code is executed when the list items are integers.
- The two methods sortIntArray() and printSortedIntArray() are used for this purpose.
- The first method sorts the integer array whereas the second method prints the sorted array.

***String Sorting***

- This part of the code is executed when the list items are strings.
- The two methods sortStringArray() and printSortedStringArray() are used for this purpose.
- The first method sorts the string array whereas the second method prints the sorted array.
